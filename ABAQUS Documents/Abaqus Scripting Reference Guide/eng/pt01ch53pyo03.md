# 53.3 Repository object







Repositories are containers that store a particular type of object; for example, the steps repository contains all the steps defined in the model. An Abaqus Scripting Interface Repository maps a key to a value. The key is usually a String, and the value is any Python object, usually an Abaqus object. A repository is similar to a Python dictionary; however, only a constructor can add an object to a repository. In addition, all of the objects in a repository are of the same base type. For more information, see ["Repositories," Section 5.3.3 of the Abaqus Scripting User's Guide](../cmd/cmd-link.md#cmd-int-acl-types-repositories). A Repository has no constructor. Abaqus creates empty repositories when you import a module. For example, Abaqus creates an empty `parts` repository when you import the `part` module.

The following methods of the Repository object are standard Python dictionary methods and are not described here:
- `has_key`
- `items`
- `keys`
- `values`
