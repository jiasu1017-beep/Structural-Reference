# 59.4 Creating attachment points by choosing a direction and a spacing







You can position attachment points by choosing a start point and a direction and by specifying the spacing of the points. If desired, you can create the attachment points by projecting the specified points onto a selected face.  You can use attachment points to define the location of point-based fasteners. For more information, see ["About fasteners," Section 29.1](pt04ch29s01.md).

**To create attachment points by choosing a direction and a spacing:**

1. From the main menu bar, select ****Tools**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Attachment**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Points Along Direction****. **Tip:**You can also create attachment points by choosing a direction and a spacing using the ![](../graphics/ico_attPtByDir.png) tool, located with the attachment tools in the Interaction module toolbox or the Property module toolbox. For a diagram of the attachment tools in the toolbox, see ["Understanding attachment points and lines," Section 59.1](pt06ch59s01.md).
2. From the current viewport, select a point representing the starting point. You can also enter the *X*-, *Y*-, and *Z*-coordinates of the point in the text field that appears in the prompt area. Abaqus/CAE displays the **Create Attachment Points Along Direction** dialog box.
3. From the dialog box, use either of the following methods to select a method for specifying the direction along which the points will be created: - Choose **End point** and click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to select a point specifying the end point of the direction vector. - Choose **Straight line** and click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to select a straight line specifying the direction vector.
4. Do either of the following to specify the spacing of the points along the direction vector: - Choose **Number of points between start and end points**, and enter the desired number of points. (This option is available only when you select an end point to specify the direction vector.) - Choose **Spacing**, and enter the distance between each attachment point. Do either of the following to specify the number of points to create: - Choose **Number of points along direction**, and enter the desired number of points. The attachment points can extend beyond the end point of the direction vector. Click ![](../graphics/ico_flipArrow.png) to reverse the direction vector. - Choose **Auto-fit points between start and end points** to allow Abaqus/CAE to determine the number of points that can be created between the start and end points with the specified spacing.
5. By default, Abaqus/CAE creates additional attachment points at both ends of the direction vector. If desired, toggle off **At start point** and/or **At end point** to prevent Abaqus/CAE from creating the additional points.
6. To project the specified points onto a selected face, display the **Projection** tabbed page, and do the following: 1. Toggle on **Project onto faces**. 2. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png), and select the faces onto which the points will be projected. The faces can be planar or nonplanar. 3. Select the method for projecting the points. - Choose **Proximity** to allow Abaqus/CAE to draw a vector from each point to the closest point on the selected faces. - Choose **Direction** to define the vector along which to project the points. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to choose the **Start point** and **End point** of the vector. For more information, see ["Understanding the projection methods," Section 59.2](pt06ch59s02.md).
7. By default, Abaqus/CAE creates a set that will contain the attachment points. If desired, you can modify the set name. Toggle off **Create set with name** if you do not want to create a set containing the attachment points.
8. Click **OK** to create the attachment points. Abaqus/CAE displays the attachment points. For information on editing attachment points, see ["Editing attachment points created by choosing a direction and a spacing," Section 59.7.1](pt06ch59s03hlb01.md).
