# 54.6 Sorting field output data







For tabular field output reports you can choose to sort all of the data in the table according to the values in any single column of the table and you can choose to sort in either ascending or descending order. 

You control which columns Abaqus/CAE includes in the table using the **Variable** options in the **Report Field Output** dialog box. (For more information, see ["Selecting field output variables," Section 54.3.2](pt05ch54s03hlb02.md).) The table has one column for each field output variable you have selected, and additional columns to identify the origin of the field output; for example, if your table includes unique nodal quantities Abaqus/CAE provides a **Node Label** (node number) column. 

Negative element labels are used in the reports to distinguish internal elements created by Abaqus/CAE from elements that you created while defining the model. If your report includes internal elements and you choose to sort by element labels, these elements will be grouped at the top or bottom of your report.

For information on sorting the data in a tabular report of probe values, see ["Entering tabular data," Section 3.2.7](pt01ch03s02s07.md).

**To sort field output report data:**

1. Locate the field output report sorting options. From the main menu bar, select ****Report**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Field Output****; then click the **Setup** tab in the dialog box that appears. The **Sort by** options are in the middle of the page.
2. Click the **Sort by** arrow to reveal the list of column choices.
3. Select the column to sort by from the list.
4. Click either **Ascending** or **Descending** to choose the order of the sort.

To generate your report, configure the remaining options in the dialog box; then click **Apply**. When you have finished, click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.
