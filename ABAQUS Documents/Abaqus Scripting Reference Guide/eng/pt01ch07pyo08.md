# 7.8 IgnoredEdgeArray object







The IgnoredEdgeArray is a sequence of [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                 objects. If the part is modified, then IgnoredEdgeArray must be updated for that part.

**Access**

```
import part
mdb.models[*name*].parts[*name*].ignoredEdges
import assembly
mdb.models[*name*].rootAssembly.allinstances.ignoredEdges
mdb.models[*name*].rootAssembly.instances[*name*].ignoredEdges
```

### 7.8.1 findAt(...)

This method returns the object or objects in the IgnoredEdgeArray located at the given coordinates.

 `findAt`                       initially uses the ACIS tolerance of 1E-6. As a result, `findAt`                       returns any [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       that is at the arbitrary point specified or at a distance of less than 1E-6 from the arbitrary point. If nothing is found, `findAt`                       uses the tolerance for imprecise geometry (applicable only for imprecise geometric entities). The arbitrary point must not be shared by a second [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md). If two [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       objects intersect or coincide at the arbitrary point, `findAt`                       chooses the first [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       that it encounters, and you should not rely on the return value being consistent.

 `findAt`                       will always try to find objects among all the ignored edges in the part or assembly instance and will not restrict itself to a subset even if the IgnoredEdgeArray represents such subset.

**Required argument**

*coordinates*

A sequence of Floats specifying the *X*-, *Y*-, and *Z*-coordinates of the object to find.

 `findAt`                                returns either an [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                                object or a sequence of [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                                objects based on the type of input.
- If *coordinates* is a sequence of Floats, `findAt` returns the [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md) object at that point.
- If you omit the *coordinates* keyword argument, `findAt` accepts as arguments a sequence of sequence of floats in the following format: ``` ignoredEdges = e.findAt(((20.19686, -169.513997, 27.798593), ), ((19.657627, -167.295749, 27.056402), ), ((18.274129, -157.144741, 25.15218), )) ```

**Optional argument**

*printWarning*

A Boolean specifying whether a message is to be printed to the CLI if no entity is found at the specified location. The default value is True.

**Return value**

An [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       object or a sequence of [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       objects.

**Exceptions**

None.

### 7.8.2 getSequenceFromMask(...)

This method returns the object or objects in the IgnoredEdgeArray identified using the specified *mask*. This command is generated when the [JournalOptions](pt01ch47pyo06.md)                       are set to COMPRESSEDINDEX. When large number of objects are involved, this method is highly efficient.

**Required argument**

*mask*

A String specifying the object or objects.

**Optional arguments**

None.

**Return value**

An [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       object or a sequence of [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       objects.

**Exceptions**

None.

### 7.8.3 getMask()

This method returns a string specifying the object or objects.

**Arguments**

None.

**Return value**

                 A String specifying the object or objects.

**Exceptions**

None.

### 7.8.4 getClosest(...)

                    This method returns a object or objects in the IgnoredEdgeArray closest to the given set of points, where the given points need not lie on the edges in the IgnoredEdgeArray.

**Required argument**

*coordinates*

A sequence of a sequence of floats, where each sequence of floats describes the *X*-, *Y*-, and *Z*-coordinates of a point.

```
r=e.getClosest(coordinates=((20.0,20.0,10.0),(-1.0, -15.0, 15),))
```

```
r.keys()
```

```
[0, 1]
```

```
r[0]
```

```
(mdb.models['Model-1'].parts['Part-1'].ignoredEdges[3],
                                 (15.7090625762939, 20.0, 10.0))
```

**Optional argument**

*searchTolerance*

A double specifying the distance within which the closest object must lie. The default value is half of the parent part/instance size.

**Return value**

This method returns a dictionary object. The key to the dictionary object is the position of the input point in the tuple specified in the *coordinates*                       starting at index 0. If a closest [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       could be found then the value is a sequence consisting of two objects. The first object in the sequence is an [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       that is close to the input point referred to by the key. The second object in the sequence, is a sequence of floats which specify the *X*-, *Y*-, and *Z*-location of the closest point on the [IgnoredEdge](pt01ch07pyo07.md)                       to the given point. See program listing above.

**Exceptions**

An exception occurs if the resulting sequence is empty.

```
Error: The mask results in an empty sequence
```
