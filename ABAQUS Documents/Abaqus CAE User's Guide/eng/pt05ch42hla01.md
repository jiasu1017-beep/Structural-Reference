# 42.1 Overview of results selection from an output database







Abaqus/CAE reads analysis results from the output database. Output database results consist of those you have saved during the analysis as field and history output variables. If, for example, you have written data to the field output portion of the output database after every 10 increments, you can now select results at 10 increment intervals only. These increment intervals are called frames.

In addition to the analysis results you have saved, you can operate on output database field output to create new results. You can display the values of both output database field output variables and field output variables that you have created in the form of a deformed, contour, symbol, or *X–Y* plot; as *X–Y* data obtained along a path through your model; by probing any model or *X–Y* plot; or in a tabular report. Furthermore, you can display a subset of your model based on field output values, and you can color code a portion of your model according to these values.

You can display output database history output values in the form of an *X–Y* plot.

Use the **Result** menu from the main menu bar to access the options affecting results; the following menu items are available:
- **Step/Frame**: Control the step and frame at which Abaqus/CAE obtains results.
- **Active Steps/Frames**: Control the subset of steps and frames that Abaqus/CAE displays when stepping through results frame by frame, in animations, and in *X--Y* plots.
- **Section Points**: Control which section points provide results for integration point variables.
- **Field Output**: The **Field Output** dialog box contains the following tabs: - **Primary Variable**: Control the variable and, if applicable, the invariant or component for which Abaqus/CAE displays results. - **Deformed Variable**: Control the variable Abaqus/CAE uses to display the deformed model shape. - **Symbol Variable**: Control the vector or tensor variable and optionally the component Abaqus/CAE uses for symbol plots. - **Status Variable**: Control the removal of elements that meet the specified result-based failure criteria from model plots.
- **History Output**: Select history output for *X--Y* plotting.
- **Options**: The **Result Options** dialog box contains the following tabs: - **Computation**: Display field output or discontinuities, control the averaging of element-based field output results, and control the computation of results at region boundaries. - **Transformation**: Apply coordinate system transformations to field output results. - **Complex Form**: Control the numeric form in which Abaqus/CAE displays complex number results. - **Caching**: Control whether analysis results are cached in memory during postprocessing and how often the output database should be checked for updated results.
