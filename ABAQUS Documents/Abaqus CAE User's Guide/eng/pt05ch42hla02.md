# 42.2 Overview of results selection from the current model database







Abaqus/CAE can read selected data from any of the models in the current model database. When you select a model in the Visualization module, Abaqus/CAE makes a subset of the loads, predefined fields, boundary conditions, and interactions specified in that model available for selection as field output variables. Once selected, you can plot contours or symbols for the selected item in a particular step of your analysis. Abaqus/CAE creates a single dummy frame for each step in the model database.

Only a subset of the loads, predefined fields, boundary conditions, and interactions you can define in a model are available for visualization; and the attributes in this section can be displayed when their propagation status is **Created in this step**, **Propagated from a previous step**, or **Modified in this step**. The following attributes can be displayed in contour plots or symbol plots in the Visualization module:

**Supported loads**

Unless stated otherwise, the loads below are supported for display for all distributions except user-defined distributions. Abaqus/CAE does not consider any amplitude data associated with the load definition when you display it in the Visualization module. Abaqus/CAE displays **(L)** before the name of each load that is available for display in the current step. 
- Concentrated force
- Moment
- Concentrated charge
- Concentrated heat flux
- Surface charge
- Concentrated concentration flux
- Surface heat flux (for all distributions except total flux)
- Surface concentration flux
- Pressure load (for all distributions except total force)

If you defined a load using a user-specified coordinate system, the modified orientation is reflected in the Visualization module as well. Abaqus/CAE also customizes the display of any load that is defined using an expression field as its custom distribution; display of loads with mapped fields is not supported. 

**Predefined fields**

Abaqus/CAE displays **(P)** before the name of each predefined field that is available for display in the current step.
- Temperature (all distributions except **From results or output database file** and only the **Constant through section** variation.)
- Velocity (translational velocity components only)

If you defined a predefined field using an expression field or a mapped field, the custom distribution is reflected in the Visualization module as well. 

**Boundary conditions**

Abaqus/CAE displays **(B)** before the name of each boundary condition that is available for display in the current step. For boundary conditions that include degrees of freedom, such as displacement/rotation, you can select the individual degree of freedom you want to display after selecting the boundary condition. The individual components available for display are indicated below in parentheses where applicable.

You can display data for any boundary condition with parameters that support distributions:
- Displacement/rotation (translational and rotational displacements)
- Velocity/angular velocity (translational and angular velocity)
- Acceleration/angular acceleration (translational and angular acceleration)
- Fluid inlet/outlet
- Fluid wall
- Temperature
- Pore pressure
- Electric potential
- Mass concentration
- Acoustic pressure
- Connector material flow

**Interactions**

Abaqus/CAE displays **(I)** before the name of each interaction that is available for display in the current step. Surface film condition (film coefficient and sink temperature) is the only supported interaction.
