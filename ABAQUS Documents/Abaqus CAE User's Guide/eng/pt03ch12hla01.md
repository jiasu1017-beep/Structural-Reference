# 12.16 Using discrete orientations for material orientations and composite layup orientations







A discrete orientation defines a spatially varying orientation at the centroid of each mesh element. The orientation can be based on the topology of the part, allowing you to define a continually varying orientation. You define the normal axis and a primary axis, and Abaqus/CAE uses these axes to construct a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. For two-dimensional and axisymmetric parts, the normal axis is always the out-of-plane direction and represents the positive 3-axis of the coordinate system. Discrete orientations can be used for material orientations and composite layup orientations.

A variety of selection methods are available to define the desired axes. The datum axis and vector value methods define a constant axis direction, whereas the region selection methods allow for varying orientations. For example, you may want to select a curved surface and allow the normal to follow the shape of the curve.

Abaqus/CAE uses the normal axis and primary axis that you specify and the following algorithm to calculate the discrete orientation:

1. Abaqus/CAE preserves the normal axis direction and uses the specified primary axis direction as a construction direction. If the specified primary axis direction and the normal axis direction form a 90 angle, the final primary axis direction will be the same as the one specified. Otherwise, the primary axis direction will be adjusted to form a Cartesian system.
2. If you define the normal axis by selecting a surface or face, Abaqus/CAE finds the closest point on the surface or face and uses the surface normal at that point as the normal axis direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00397.gif)).
3. If you define the primary axis by selecting an edge, Abaqus/CAE finds the closest point on the edge and uses the edge tangent at that point as the primary axis construction direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00398.gif)).
4. Abaqus/CAE computes the secondary axis direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00399.gif)) by taking the cross product of the primary axis direction and the normal axis direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00400.gif)).
5. Abaqus/CAE computes the final primary axis direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00401.gif)) by taking the cross product of the secondary axis direction and the normal axis direction (![](../graphics/usi_eqn00402.gif)).

**To define a discrete orientation:**

1. To display the **Edit Discrete Orientation** dialog box, do the following: 1. Assign a material orientation or create a composite layup. - Display the **Edit Material Orientation** dialog box using the procedure described in ["Assigning a material orientation or rebar reference orientation," Section 12.15.4](pt03ch12s15s01.md). - Display the composite layup editor using one of the procedures described in ["Creating and editing composite layups," Section 12.14](pt03ch12s14.md). 2. Click the arrow to the right of the **Definition** field, and select **Discrete** from the list that appears. 3. Click ![](../graphics/ico_edit.png).
2. For three-dimensional parts, choose the coordinate system axis that you want the **Normal axis direction** to represent in the resultant orientation.
3. For three-dimensional parts, define the normal axis of the orientation using one of the following methods: - Select **Surface/Faces** to select a region, and do the following: 1. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) . 2. From the prompt area, select **individually** or select **by angle** and enter an angle. For more information, see ["Using the angle and feature edge method to select multiple objects," Section 6.2.3](pt01ch06s02hlb03.md). 3. Identify the regions that define the normal axis of the material orientation by selecting the regions in the viewport or by clicking **Surfaces** or **Sets** in the prompt area and selecting an existing surface or set. - Select **Datum axis** to select datum geometry, and do the following: 1. To create a datum axis, click ![](../graphics/ico_createDtmAxis.png) and select two points in the viewport that define the axis. 2. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png). 3. Select the datum axis that defines the normal axis of the material orientation. - Select **Vector (i,j,k)**, and enter the values for the vector components. Abaqus/CAE displays arrows in the viewport that indicate your selections and axis direction; for example, arrows labeled `N-3`. If necessary, you can click **Flip Direction** to obtain the desired direction.
4. Choose the coordinate system axis that you want the **Primary axis direction** to represent in the resultant orientation.
5. Define the primary axis of the orientation using one of the following methods: - Select **Edges** to select a region, and do the following: 1. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png). 2. From the prompt area, select **individually** or select **by edge angle** and enter an angle. 3. Identify the regions that define the primary axis of the material orientation by selecting the regions in the viewport or by clicking **Sets** in the prompt area and selecting an existing set. - Select **Datum axis** to select datum geometry, and do the following: 1. To create a datum axis, click ![](../graphics/ico_createDtmAxis.png) and select two points in the viewport that define the axis. 2. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png). 3. Select the datum axis that defines the primary axis of the material orientation. - Select **Vector (i,j,k)**, and enter the values for the vector components. Abaqus/CAE displays arrows in the viewport that indicate your selections and axis direction; for example, arrows labeled `P-1`. If necessary, you can click ![](../graphics/ico_flipArrow.png) to obtain the desired direction.
6. Click **Continue** to save the discrete orientation definition and to close the **Edit Discrete Orientation** dialog box.
