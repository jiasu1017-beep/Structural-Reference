# *SUBMODEL







### *SUBMODELSpecify driven boundary nodes in submodeling analysis.

This option is used to specify the total list of “driven regions” for a submodel.

**Products: **Abaqus/Standard  Abaqus/Explicit  Abaqus/CAE  

**Type: **Model data  

**Level: **Part,  Part instance,  Assembly  

**Abaqus/CAE: **Load module and model attribute

### **Optional, mutually exclusive parameters: **

ACOUSTIC TO STRUCTURE

Include this parameter if the submodel will be driven at the specified surface by the acoustic pressure from a global coupled acoustic-structural model.

SHELL TO SOLID

Include this parameter if a solid element submodel will be driven by a global shell model. If this parameter is included, all driven nodes must be on solid elements and must be located in regions modeled with shell elements in the global model. If this parameter is included on any [*SUBMODEL](ch18abk38.md) option in an input file, it must be included on all [*SUBMODEL](ch18abk38.md) options in the input file.

### **Required parameter for SHELL TO SOLID submodeling: **

SHELL THICKNESS

If the OFFSET parameter is not used on the [*SHELL SECTION](ch18abk15.md) or [*SHELL GENERAL SECTION](ch18abk14.md) option in the global model, set this parameter equal to the maximum value of the shell thickness in the global model (given in the units used in the model). If the OFFSET parameter is used in the global model, set this parameter equal to twice the maximum distance from the reference surface to the top or bottom shell surface.

### **Optional parameters: **

ABSOLUTE EXTERIOR TOLERANCE

Set this parameter equal to the absolute value (given in the units used in the model) by which a driven node of the submodel may lie outside the region of the elements of the global model. If this parameter is not used or has a value of 0.0, the EXTERIOR TOLERANCE will apply. For shell-to-solid submodeling the driven node may lie within a region defined by half the value of the SHELL THICKNESS parameter plus the exterior tolerance.

EXTERIOR TOLERANCE

Set this parameter equal to the fraction of the average element size in the global model by which a driven node of the submodel may lie outside the region of the elements of the global model. The default is 0.05. For shell-to-solid submodeling the driven node may lie within a region defined by half the value of the SHELL THICKNESS parameter plus the exterior tolerance.

If both tolerance parameters are specified by the user, Abaqus uses the tighter tolerance.

GLOBAL ELSET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set in the global model that will be searched for elements whose responses will be used to drive the submodel. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus will search all elements in the global model that lie in the vicinity of the submodel.

This parameter must be used with the ACOUSTIC TO STRUCTURE parameter when the acoustic pressures act on both sides of a shell.

INTERSECTION ONLY

Include this parameter to specify that Abaqus ignore driven nodes found to lie outside the region of elements of the global model, after accounting for the exterior search tolerance.

This parameter can be used only with TYPE=NODE. This parameter cannot be used with the ACOUSTIC TO STRUCTURE or SHELL TO SOLID parameters.

TYPE

This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses. It determines whether global model communication to the submodel occurs through nodes or through surfaces.

Set TYPE=NODE (default) for node-based submodeling. Node-based submodel definitions will be accompanied by [*BOUNDARY](ch02abk12.md), SUBMODEL definitions.

Set TYPE=SURFACE for surface-based submodeling. This parameter setting cannot be used with the ACOUSTIC TO STRUCTURE, SHELL TO SOLID, or SHELL THICKNESS parameters. Surface-based submodel definitions will be accompanied by [*DSLOAD](ch04abk42.md), SUBMODEL definitions.
