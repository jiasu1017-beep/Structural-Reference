# 59.5 Creating patterns of attachment points based on edges







You can position attachment points in a simple pattern along a single edge or connected edges. You can then position the points in a pattern of rows on an adjacent face or along a specified direction. If desired, you can project the specified points onto a selected face. You can use the attachment points to define the location of point-based fasteners. For more information, see ["About fasteners," Section 29.1](pt04ch29s01.md).

**To create patterns of attachment points based on edges:**

1. From the main menu bar, select ****Tools**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Attachment**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Points Offset From Edges****. **Tip:**You can also create attachment points by choosing edges and offsets using the ![](../graphics/ico_attPtOffEdge.png) tool, located with the attachment tools in the Property module or Interaction module toolbox. For more information on the attachment tools in the toolbox, see ["Understanding attachment points and lines," Section 59.1](pt06ch59s01.md).
2. From the current viewport, select the edges on which to assign the attachment points. You can select multiple edges as long as the edges are connected and do not branch. You can click **Sets** from the right side of the prompt area to use a previously defined set. If the edge selection forms a closed loop, select the starting vertex for point generation from the viewport. A red arrow appears to indicate the direction of point generation from the start point.
3. In the prompt area, click **Flip** to reverse the direction of point generation, if necessary, and click **Yes**. Abaqus/CAE displays the **Create Attachment Points Offset From Edges** dialog box.
4. From the dialog box, specify the points along the edges. - Select **by number** to define the number of attachment points along the edge selection. Abaqus/CAE automatically spaces the points along the edges. 1. Enter the number of points along the edges. 2. Enter the desired offset of the first attachment point from the start point. 3. Enter the desired offset of the last attachment point from the end point. - Select **by spacing** to define the distance between the attachment points. 1. Enter the spacing between the points. 2. Enter the desired offset of the first attachment point from the start point. 3. Specify the number of points along the edges, or select **Auto-fit** to have Abaqus/CAE determine the number of attachment points. If you specify the number of points, Abaqus/CAE will create only the points between the start point and the end point; any points extending past the end point will not be created.
5. If desired, define the pattern of rows of the attachment points by specifying the following: - Enter the number of rows in the pattern. The default value of 1 creates a single row of attachment points. - Enter a value for spacing to define the distance between the rows of the pattern. - Enter the offset distance of the first row of the pattern from the edges. The default value of 0 will create the first row of the pattern on the edges. - Select **Orthogonal to faces** as the offset method, and click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to select an adjacent face on which to position the pattern. - Select **Along direction** as the offset method, and click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to specify the start and end points of the direction vector.
6. To project the specified points onto a selected face, display the **Projection** tabbed page and do the following: 1. Toggle on **Project onto faces**. 2. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png), and select the faces onto which the points will be projected. The faces can be planar or nonplanar. 3. Select the method for projecting the points. - Choose **Proximity** to allow Abaqus/CAE to draw a vector from each point to the closest point on the selected faces. - Choose **Direction** to define the vector along which to project the points. Click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png) to choose the **Start point** and **End point** of the vector. For more information, see ["Understanding the projection methods," Section 59.2](pt06ch59s02.md).
7. By default, Abaqus/CAE creates a set that contains the attachment points. If desired, you can modify the set name. Toggle off **Create set with name** if you do not want to create a set containing the attachment points.
8. Click **OK** to create the attachment points. Abaqus/CAE displays the attachment points. For information on editing attachment points, see ["Editing attachment points created by a pattern based on edges," Section 59.7.2](pt06ch59s03hlb02.md).
