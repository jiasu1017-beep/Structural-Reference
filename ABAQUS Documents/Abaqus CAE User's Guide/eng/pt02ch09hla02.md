# 9.11 Managing macros







To manage macros containing a set of Abaqus Scripting Interface commands, select ****File**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Macro Manager**** from the main menu bar. When you create a macro, Abaqus/CAE records a sequence of Abaqus Scripting Interface commands in a macro file while you interact with Abaqus/CAE. Each command corresponds to an interaction with Abaqus/CAE, and replaying the macro reproduces the sequence of interactions.

Macros are stored in a file called `abaqusMacros.py`. Abaqus/CAE searches three directories for `abaqusMacros.py`, in the following order:
- The site directory of the Abaqus installation.
- Your home directory.
- The current working directory.

The `abaqusMacros.py` file can exist in more than one of these directories. The **Macro Manager** contains a list of the existing macros that Abaqus/CAE detected in all the `abaqusMacros.py` files. If a macro uses the same name in more than one `abaqusMacros.py` file, Abaqus/CAE uses the last macro encountered.

Your macro will run only in the same context in which it was recorded. For example, if you create a macro that copies a part named `gear1` to a new part named `gear2`, the macro will be executed in a new Abaqus/CAE session only if a part named `gear1` exists.

The Abaqus Scripting Interface commands are stored in ASCII text. You can edit `abaqusMacros.py` with a standard text editor; however, any errors that you introduce into the file will prevent the **Macro Manager** from displaying. For more information on commands, see the [Abaqus Scripting User's Guide](../cmd/cmd-link.md#cmd). 

**Tip:**If you edit any of the `abaqusMacros.py` files using a text editor, you can click **Reload** from the buttons at the bottom of the **Macro Manager** to update the macro list without closing the manager.

**To create a macro:**

1. From the main menu bar, select ****File**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Macro Manager****. The **Macro Manager** dialog box appears.
2. From the buttons across the bottom of the **Macro Manager** dialog box, click **Create**.
3. Enter a name for the macro in the **Create Macro** dialog box that appears, and click **Continue**. You cannot overwrite an existing macro. Each of your interactions with Abaqus/CAE is stored as a command in the `abaqusMacros.py` file. A **Recording macro** dialog box appears to remind you the macro is recording. In addition, the **Create**, **Delete**, **Run**, and **Reload** buttons are not available in the **Macro Manager** while the macro is recording.
4. Click the **Stop recording** button to save the macro in `abaqusMacros.py`. Abaqus/CAE updates the macro list in the **Macro Manager**.

**To delete a macro:**

1. From the main menu bar, select ****File**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Macro Manager****. The **Macro Manager** dialog box appears.
2. Select the macro to delete. You can select more than one macro.
3. From the buttons across the bottom of the **Macro Manager** dialog box, click **Delete**.
4. From the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to confirm your action. Abaqus/CAE deletes the macro from `abaqusMacros.py` and updates the macro list in the **Macro Manager**. You cannot recover a deleted macro.

**To run a macro:**

1. From the main menu bar, select ****File**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Macro Manager****. The **Macro Manager** dialog box appears.
2. Select the macro to run.
3. From the buttons across the bottom of the **Macro Manager** dialog box, click **Run**. You can run only one macro; the **Run** button is not available if you selected more than one macro. Abaqus/CAE runs the commands in the selected macro and displays a message in the message area when the macro execution completes.
