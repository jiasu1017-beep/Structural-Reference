# 4.7 Summary

* The formulation and order of integration used in a continuum element can have a significant effect on the accuracy and cost of the analysis.
* First-order (linear) elements using full integration are prone to shear locking and normally should not be used.
* First-order, reduced-integration elements are prone to hourglassing; sufficient mesh refinement minimizes this problem.
* When using first-order, reduced-integration elements in a simulation where bending deformation will occur, use at least four elements through the thickness.
* Hourglassing is rarely a problem in the second-order, reduced-integration elements in Abaqus/Standard. You should consider using these elements for most general applications when there is no contact.
* The accuracy of the incompatible mode elements available in Abaqus/Standard is strongly influenced by the amount of element distortion.
* The numerical accuracy of the results depends on the mesh that has been used. Ideally a mesh refinement study should be carried out to ensure that the mesh provides a unique solution to the problem. However, remember that using a converged mesh does not ensure that the results from the finite element simulation will match the actual behavior of the physical problem: that also depends on other approximations and idealizations in the model.
* In general, refine the mesh mainly in regions where you want accurate results; a finer mesh is required to predict accurate stresses than is needed to calculate accurate displacements.
* Advanced features such as submodeling are available in Abaqus to help you to obtain useful results for complex simulations.
