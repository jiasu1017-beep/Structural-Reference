# 37.3 Creating springs and dashpots connecting two points







You can define springs and dashpots that connect two points and exhibit the same linear behavior independent of field variables. For more information, see ["Springs," Section 32.1.1 of the Abaqus Analysis User's Guide](../usb/usb-link.md#usb-elm-espring), and ["Dashpots," Section 32.2.1 of the Abaqus Analysis User's Guide](../usb/usb-link.md#usb-elm-edashpot).

You can obtain history data of stress and strain from a spring/dashpot by using the history output request editor in the Step module. In the **Domain** section of the editor, select **Springs/Dashpots** and choose the desired spring/dashpot from the menu that appears. For more information, see ["Creating an output request," Section 14.12.1](pt03ch14s12hlb01.md).

**To create springs and dashpots that connect two points:**

1. From the main menu bar in the Property module or the Interaction module, select ****Special**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Springs/Dashpots**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Create****.
2. In the **Create Springs/Dashpots** dialog box that appears, name the springs/dashpots, select **Connect two points**, and click **Continue**.
3. Select the first point for the first spring/dashpot using one of the following methods: - Select the point in the viewport. (For more information, see [Chapter 6, "Selecting objects within the viewport](pt01ch06.md).") **Tip:**The ![](../graphics/ico_filterVisible.png) **Select the Entity Closest to the Screen** tool in the **Selection** toolbar is toggled off by default. If you make an ambiguous selection, Abaqus/CAE highlights the point and displays a description of the point in the lower left corner of the viewport. Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to cycle through the possible selections, and click **OK** to confirm your selection. If the model contains a combination of geometry and mesh components, select one of the following from the prompt area: - Select **Geometry** to define the spring/dashpot for geometry or for a reference point. - Select **Mesh** to define the spring/dashpot for a mesh. - To select from a list of existing sets, do the following: 1. Click **Sets** on the right side of the prompt area to display the **Region Selection** dialog box containing a list of available sets. 2. Select a set that contains only one point, and click **Continue**. **Note:**The default selection method is based on the selection method you most recently employed. To revert to the other method, click **Select in Viewport** or **Sets** on the right side of the prompt area.
4. Select the second point for the first spring/dashpot using one of the methods described in the previous step. The first spring/dashpot point pair and a dashed line connecting them are highlighted in the viewport.
5. Continue selecting pairs of points for additional springs/dashpots as described in the previous steps. When you have finished selecting point pairs, click **Done** in the prompt area. The **Edit Springs/Dashpots** dialog box appears. The point pairs that you selected to define each spring/dashpot are listed in the **Spring/Dashpot Point Pairs** table.
6. From the **Spring/Dashpot Point Pairs** table, you can do the following: - To define additional springs/dashpots with the same behavior, click ![](../graphics/ico_add.png) and repeat the point selection procedures described in the previous steps to define the first and second points of each spring/dashpot. - To edit a point in the table, select the point in the table, double-click on it or click ![](../graphics/ico_edit.png), and reselect a point. The selection highlighting in the viewport is updated to show the newly edited point. - To identify a specific spring/dashpot in the viewport, select the desired row number. The highlighted dashed line connecting the selected point pairs appears bolder in the viewport. - To remove springs/dashpots from the table, select the desired row numbers and click ![](../graphics/ico_delete.png). - To remove all springs/dashpots from the table, click ![](../graphics/ico_error.png).
7. Click the arrow next to the **Axis** field, and select an option from the list that appears: - Select **Follow line of action** to have the axis of each spring/dashpot follow the line of action of the two points. - Select **Specify fixed direction** to specify the degree of freedom at each point on the spring/dashpot (Abaqus/Standard analyses only).
8. If you selected **Specify fixed direction**, do the following in the **Direction** portion of the dialog box: - Click the arrow next to the **Point 1 degree of freedom** field, and select the degree of freedom with which the springs/dashpots are associated at their first point. - Click the arrow next to the **Point 2 degree of freedom** field, and select the degree of freedom with which the springs/dashpots are associated at their second point. - The global coordinate system determines the default spring/dashpot orientations. To specify an orientation for the springs/dashpots, click ![](../graphics/ico_selectBlue.png). Specify the orientation for the springs/dashpots using one of the following methods: - Click **Datum CSYS List** from the prompt area to select a name from a list of datum coordinate systems. - Select a datum coordinate system in the viewport. - Click **Use Global CSYS** from the prompt area to use the global coordinate system. Abaqus/CAE displays the local coordinate system specified for springs/dashpots in the viewport.
9. In the **Property** portion of the dialog box, check the appropriate box to include: - **Spring stiffness**. Enter the force per relative displacement for springs. - **Dashpot coefficient**. Enter the force per relative velocity for dashpots. If you define both spring and dashpot behaviors, they act in parallel.
10. Click **OK** to create the springs/dashpots and to close the **Edit Springs/Dashpots** dialog box. Symbols appear in the viewport that represent the springs/dashpots that you just created.
