# 20.13 Editing dimensions







Dimensions in Abaqus/CAE are used to precisely control sizes and distances, to annotate reference values, and to create parameters that are, in turn, used to define equations relating different pieces of geometry. You can edit any dimension in a sketch as follows:
- Change the dimension value. Changing a dimension value modifies the associated Sketcher geometry.
- Designate the dimension as a reference dimension. Reference dimensions indicate quantities whose values are controlled elsewhere in the same sketch or dimensions of reference geometry that are controlled in another sketch.
- Associate the dimension with a parameter. Parameters control Sketcher geometry by defining relationships between different pieces of geometry, including reference geometry.

The effects of modifying a dimension depend on how the dimension is used in the sketch. For example, if a radius has an equal radius constraint, editing the radius dimension will change all of the constrained radii. Likewise, if a dimension is associated with a parameter, editing its value will change the value of all the parameters that refer to it. For more information on constraints, dimensions, and parameters, see ["Controlling sketch geometry," Section 20.7](pt03ch20s07.md).

**To edit dimensions:**

1. From the tools in the Sketcher toolbox, select the dimension modification tool ![](../graphics/ico_sketchDimensionEdit.png). For a diagram of the tools in the Sketcher toolbox, see ["The Sketcher tools," Section 20.4.1](pt03ch20s04s01.md). Abaqus/CAE displays prompts in the prompt area to guide you through the procedure.
2. Select the dimension you want to change. Abaqus/CAE highlights the selected dimension and opens the **Edit Dimension** dialog box.
3. Enter a new value for the dimension. **Note:**You cannot edit the value field for reference dimensions or for parameters whose values are defined using an equation.
4. Toggle **Reference** to switch between a standard dimension whose value is used to control the sketch geometry and a reference dimension that reads the current value from the geometry.
5. Click **f(x)** to associate the dimension with a new parameter or to edit a previously associated parameter. Abaqus/CAE opens the **Parameter Manager** for editing. For more information, see ["Adding and editing parameters," Section 20.12.5](pt03ch20s12hlb05.md).
6. When you are finished, click **Apply** in the **Edit Dimension** dialog box to update the sketch. Abaqus/CAE updates the dimension and geometry as required. If your edits result in an overconstraint, the conflicting constraints, dimensions, and parameters are indicated in magenta (for more information, see ["Fully constrained geometry," Section 20.7.4](pt03ch20s07s04.md)).
7. To edit more dimensions, repeat the above steps beginning with Step 2.
8. When you have finished editing dimensions, do one of the following: - Click mouse button 2 anywhere in the Abaqus/CAE window. - Select any tool in the Sketcher toolbox. - Click the cancel button ![](../graphics/afxI_cancel.png) in the prompt area.
