### Controlling the writing and reading of restart data in an Abaqus/Standard analysis

### **At least one of the following parameters is required: **

READ

Include this parameter to specify that this analysis is a restart of a previous analysis. The basic model definition data (elements, materials, nodes) cannot be changed at such a restart. However, element sets, node sets, and [*AMPLITUDE](ch01abk09.md) tables can be added, and history data subsequent to that part of the history already analyzed can be changed.

WRITE

Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis.

### **Optional parameters if the READ parameter is used: **

CYCLE

If the new analysis is restarted from a previous low-cycle fatigue analysis, set this parameter equal to the cycle number within the specified step of the low-cycle fatigue analysis after which the analysis will resume. Since the new analysis can be restarted only from the end of a loading cycle in the previous low-cycle fatigue analysis, the INC parameter is irrelevant and is ignored if the CYCLE parameter is specified.

If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the last cycle for the specified step.

END STEP

This parameter specifies that the user wishes to terminate the current step in the analysis from which the restart is being made. 

This parameter is useful when the user wishes to redefine the loading history, output options, or tolerance controls, etc. If this parameter is included, the data must contain further step definitions to define how the analysis will continue.

If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will continue the analysis to complete the current step as it is defined in the run from which the restart is being made.

INC

Set this parameter equal to the increment number within the step specified by the STEP parameter, after which the analysis will resume.

If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the step specified on the STEP parameter.

ITERATION

If the new analysis is restarted from a previous direct cyclic analysis, set this parameter equal to the iteration number within the specified step of the direct cyclic analysis after which the analysis will resume. Since the new analysis can be restarted only from the end of a loading cycle in the previous direct cyclic analysis, the INC parameter is irrelevant and is ignored if the ITERATION parameter is specified.

If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the last iteration for the specified step.

STEP

Set this parameter equal to the step number at which the restart will be made. 

If this parameter is omitted, the analysis will restart at the last available step found.

### **Optional parameters if the WRITE parameter is used: **

FREQUENCY

This parameter specifies the increments at which restart information will be written. For example, FREQUENCY=2 will write restart information at increments 2, 4, 6, etc.

For a direct cyclic analysis this parameter specifies the iteration numbers at which restart information will be written; restart information will be written only at the end of an iteration.

For a low-cycle fatigue analysis this parameter specifies the cycle numbers at which restart information will be written; restart information will be written only at the end of a cycle.

When restart is requested in an analysis, restart information is always written at the end of a step. Set FREQUENCY=0 to discontinue the writing of restart data.

The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive. The default is FREQUENCY=1.

NUMBER INTERVAL

Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the [*RESTART](ch17abk16.md) data are to be written. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer.

Specifying the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter is the recommended method of synchronizing restart information when performing a co-simulation. In this case Abaqus/Standard will write restart information at the co-simulation target time immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive. The default is FREQUENCY=1.

TIME MARKS

Set TIME MARKS=YES (default) to write results at the exact times dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

Set TIME MARKS=NO to write the restart at the increment ending immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

When used with the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter in a co-simulation, the TIME MARKS parameter is always set to NO to write restart information at the co-simulation target time after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

OVERLAY

This parameter specifies that only one increment should be retained per step, thus minimizing the storage space needed.

When the OVERLAY parameter is included, each increment written overlays the previous increment, if any, written for the same step. If this parameter is omitted, data are retained for every increment. In either case the last increment of every step is retained.

**There are no data lines associated with this option.**

### Controlling the writing and reading of restart data in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis

### **At least one of the following parameters is required: **

READ

Include this parameter to specify that this analysis is a restart of a previous analysis. The basic model definition data (elements, materials, nodes) cannot be changed at such a restart. However, element sets, node sets, and [*AMPLITUDE](ch01abk09.md) tables can be added, and history data subsequent to that part of the history already analyzed can be changed.

WRITE

Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis.

### **Required parameter if the READ parameter is used: **

STEP

Set this parameter equal to the step number at which the restart will be made. If the END STEP and INTERVAL parameters are omitted, the analysis will resume after the last interval available in this step.

### **Optional parameters if the READ parameter is used: **

END STEP

Include this parameter to specify that the current step should be terminated at this point. The INTERVAL parameter is required when this parameter is used.

This parameter is useful when the user wishes to redefine the loading history, contact surface definitions, etc.

If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Explicit will continue the analysis from the last available restart interval to complete the current step as it is defined in the run from which the restart is being made.

INTERVAL

Set this parameter equal to the interval number within the step specified by the STEP parameter after which the analysis will resume. The END STEP parameter is required when this parameter is used.

### **Optional parameters if the WRITE parameter is used: **

NUMBER INTERVAL

Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the [*RESTART](ch17abk16.md) data are to be written. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer. The default is NUMBER INTERVAL=1.

Abaqus/Explicit will always write the restart data at the beginning and end of the step. For example, if NUMBER INTERVAL=10, Abaqus/Explicit will write 11 restart states, consisting of the values at the beginning of the step and the values at 10 evenly spaced intervals throughout the step.

For a co-simulation Abaqus/Explicit will write restart information at the co-simulation target time immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

TIME MARKS

Set TIME MARKS=NO (default) to write the restart at the increment ending immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

Set TIME MARKS=YES to write results at the exact times dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter. TIME MARKS=YES cannot be used when either the FIXED TIME INCREMENTATION or DIRECT USER CONTROL parameter is included on the [*DYNAMIC](ch04abk43.md) option (["Explicit dynamic analysis," Section 6.3.3 of the Abaqus Analysis User's Guide](../usb/usb-link.md#usb-anl-aexpdynamic)).

For a co-simulation the TIME MARKS parameter is always set to NO to write restart information at the co-simulation target time after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

OVERLAY

This parameter specifies that only one increment should be retained per step, thus minimizing the storage space needed.

When the OVERLAY parameter is included, each increment written overlays the previous increment, if any, written for the same step. If this parameter is omitted, data are retained for every increment. In either case the last increment of every step is retained.

SINGLE

This parameter specifies that only single precision restart data are to be written when the double precision executable is run.

When the single precision executable is run, this parameter is ignored and only single precision restart data will be written. If this parameter is omitted, double precision restart data will be written when the double precision executable is run.

**There are no data lines associated with this option.**

### Controlling the writing and reading of restart data in an Abaqus/CFD analysis

### **At least one of the following parameters is required: **

READ

Include this parameter to specify that this analysis is a restart of a previous analysis. The basic model definition data (elements, materials, nodes) cannot be changed at such a restart. However, element sets, node sets, and [*AMPLITUDE](ch01abk09.md) tables can be added, and history data subsequent to that part of the history already analyzed can be changed.

WRITE

Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis.

### **Optional parameters if the READ parameter is used: **

END STEP

This parameter specifies that the user wishes to terminate the current step in the analysis from which the restart is being made. 

This parameter is useful when the user wishes to redefine the boundary condition history, output options, or solver settings, etc. If this parameter is included, the data must contain further step definitions to define how the analysis will continue.

If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/CFD will continue the analysis to complete the current step as it is defined in the run from which the restart is being made.

INC

Set this parameter equal to the increment number within the step specified by the STEP parameter, after which the analysis will resume.

If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the step specified on the STEP parameter.

STEP

Set this parameter equal to the step number at which the restart will be made. 

If this parameter is omitted, the analysis will restart at the last available step found.

### **Optional parameters if the WRITE parameter is used: **

FREQUENCY

This parameter specifies the increments at which restart information will be written.

When restart is requested in an analysis, restart information is always written at the end of a step. Set FREQUENCY=0 to discontinue the writing of restart data.

The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive. The default is FREQUENCY=1.

NUMBER INTERVAL

Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the [*RESTART](ch17abk16.md) data are to be written. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer.

Specifying the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter is the recommended method of synchronizing restart information when performing a co-simulation. In this case Abaqus/CFD will write restart information at the co-simulation target time immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.

The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive.
