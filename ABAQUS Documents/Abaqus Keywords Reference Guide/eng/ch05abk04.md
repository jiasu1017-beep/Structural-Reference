# *ELCOPY







### *ELCOPYCreate elements by copying from an existing element set.

This option is used to copy an element set to create new elements.

**Products: **Abaqus/Standard  Abaqus/Explicit  Abaqus/CFD  Abaqus/CAE  

**Type: **Model data  

**Level: **Part,  Part instance  

**Abaqus/CAE: **Not applicable; copying portions of sketches and instancing of parts serve similar purposes.

##### **Reference:**

- ["Element definition," Section 2.2.1 of the Abaqus Analysis User's Guide](../usb/usb-link.md#usb-int-ielement)

### **Required parameters: **

ELEMENT SHIFT

Set this parameter equal to an integer that will be added to each of the existing element numbers to define the element numbers of the elements being created.

OLD SET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set being copied. The elements that are copied are those that belong to this set at the time this option is encountered.

SHIFT NODES

Set this parameter equal to an integer that will be added to each of the node numbers of the existing elements to define the node numbers of the elements being created.

### **Optional parameters: **

NEW SET

Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set to which the elements created by the operation will be assigned. If this parameter is omitted, the newly created elements are not assigned to an element set.

REFLECT

Include this parameter to modify the node numbering sequence on the elements being created, which is necessary in some cases to avoid creating elements that violate the Abaqus convention for counterclockwise element numbering. This parameter can be used only with continuum elements and usually is required only when the nodes have been generated using the [*NCOPY](ch14abk01.md) option.
