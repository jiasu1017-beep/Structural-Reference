# 76.4 Controlling curve refinement







Abaqus/CAE uses a faceted representation of a curved face or a curved edge when displaying a part or part instance. When you are working in the Part module, you can use the **Curve refinement** option from the **Part Display Options** dialog box to specify the degree of this faceting applied to the current part. You can select one of five faceting levels between extra coarse and extra fine. Set the refinement to **Extra Coarse** to speed up display of a large model. Set the refinement to **Extra Fine** if you want to create a very accurate display for printing. Abaqus/CAE applies the curve refinement setting only to the part in the current viewport. 

In addition, Abaqus/CAE uses the faceted representation of a part instance in the Assembly module when determining contact between part instances and when determining the position of attachment lines. You use the **Curve refinement** option to control the accuracy of the contact and position computations. 

**To control curve refinement:**

1. Locate the **Curve refinement** options. From the main menu bar, select ****View**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Part Display Options****. In the dialog box that appears, click the **General** tab.
2. Select the desired curve refinement setting.
3. Click **OK** to implement your changes and to close the dialog box. Abaqus/CAE applies the curve refinement setting only to the part in the current viewport.
