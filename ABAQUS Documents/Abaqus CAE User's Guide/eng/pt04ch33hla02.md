# 33.4 Defining nonstructural mass







You can define nonstructural mass for a region on a part or on an assembly. For more information, see ["Nonstructural mass definition," Section 2.7.1 of the Abaqus Analysis User's Guide](../usb/usb-link.md#usb-int-anonstructuralmass).

**To define nonstructural mass:**

1. From the main menu bar in the Property module or the Interaction module, select ****Special**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Inertia**![](../graphics/images/arrow.gif)**Create****.
2. In the **Create Inertia** dialog box that appears, name the inertia, select **Nonstructural mass**, and click **Continue**.
3. Select the region for which you want to define nonstructural mass using one of the following methods: - Select the region in the viewport. When you have finished selecting, click mouse button 2. If the model contains a combination of orphan mesh elements and geometry, select one of the following from the prompt area: - Select **Geometry** to define the nonstructural mass for the geometric portions of a part or assembly or for a reference point. - Select **Mesh** to define the nonstructural mass for orphan mesh components. You can use the angle method to select a group of nodes from an orphan mesh. For more information, see ["Using the angle and feature edge method to select multiple objects," Section 6.2.3](pt01ch06s02hlb03.md). - To select from a list of existing sets, do the following: 1. Click **Sets** on the right side of the prompt area to display the **Region Selection** dialog box containing a list of available sets. 2. Select the set of interest, and click **Continue**. **Note:**The default selection method is based on the selection method you most recently employed. To revert to the other method, click **Select in Viewport** or **Sets** on the right side of the prompt area. The **Edit Inertia** dialog box appears. The region to which you are applying the nonstructural mass is highlighted in the viewport.
4. Choose the **Units** that you will use to specify the nonstructural mass magnitude. The available types depend on the type of region that you selected. - Select **Total Mass** to specify the magnitude in the form of a total mass value. - Select **Mass per Volume** to specify the magnitude in the form of mass per unit volume. - Select **Mass per Area** to specify the magnitude in the form of mass per unit area. - Select **Mass per Length** to specify the magnitude in the form of mass per unit length.
5. Enter the nonstructural mass magnitude in the **Magnitude** field in the units you chose in the previous step.
6. If you specify the mass in the form of a total mass value and the region as a set, you can choose the **Distribution** method for distributing the mass over the region. - Select **Mass Proportional** to distribute the total mass among the members of the set in proportion to the structural mass. The underlying structural density is scaled uniformly over the region; hence, the center of mass is not altered. - Select **Volume Proportional** to distribute the total mass among the members of the set in proportion to the volume in the initial configuration. A uniform value is added to the underlying structural density over the region; hence, if the region has a nonuniform structural density, its center of mass may be altered.
7. Click **OK** to save your data and to close the dialog box. Symbols appear in the viewport that represent the nonstructural mass that you just created.
